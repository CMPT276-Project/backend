# What is this?

This repository serves as a working POC of the backend component of our Kahoot style game.

This POC will be concerned with two components of our game: the backend, which consists of setting up the database and establishing a WebSocket server, and the database, which will store the scores of our players.

# Prerequisites

- NodeJS and NPM (as of writing this document, `v18.18.2` and `9.8.1` respectively)

# Running

```bash
npm install package.json
npm start
```

Go to `localhost:8080`
