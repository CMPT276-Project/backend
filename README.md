# What is this?

This repository serves as a working POC of the backend component of our Kahoot style game.

This POC will be concerned with two components of our game: the backend, which consists of setting up the database and establishing a WebSocket server, and the database, which will store the scores of our players.

# Prerequisites

- NodeJS and NPM (as of writing this document, `v18.18.2` and `9.8.1` respectively)

# Running

For production environments:

```bash
npm install
npm run migrate
npm start
```

For testing/development environments:

```bash
npm install
DB_PATH=./testing.sqlite3 npm run migrate
npm test
```

Testing scripts default to `./testing.sqlite3` instead of `./db.sqlite3` due to the potentially destructive nature of the database tests; by forcing different databases, we can prevent accidental data loss due to wrong command invocation.

# Howto

## Creating a user

To create a user send a GET request to `/api/v1/user/register`, you will receive a JSON payload containing a GUID. Internally, the database will store the GUIDs as the user's name as well.

## Changing the user's name

To change a user's name, send a POST request to `/api/v1/user/:guid`, where `:guid` is the GUID returned from sending a GET request`/api/v1/user/register`. The POST body should contain a JSON object with a single field: `name: name-to-set`.

## Getting a user's record

To get all data associated with a user, send a GET request to `/api/v1/user/:guid`, where `:guid` is the GUID returned from the GET request to `/api/v1/user/register`. The response's body contains a JSON object with the following fields: `id` and `score`.

## Get scoreboard

To get the scoreboard, send a GET request to `/api/v1/score`. The response will be an array of objects (each object has the keys: `name` and `score`) encoded as a JSON object.

## Get a user's score

To get a user's score, send a GET request to `/api/v1/score/:guid`, where `:guid` is the GUID of the user. The response will be a JSON object containing a single key, `score`.

## Update a user's score

To update a user's score, send a PATCH request to `/api/v1/score/:guid`, where `:guid` is the GUID of the user. The request body should contain a JSON object with a single key, `score`, and a integer value to update by.

# Dependency Rationale

## Fastify

Fastify appears to be the replacement/alternative to Express as the latter has seen only a handful of commits (most of which seem to be dependency updates) for this year. 

Stable and well-maintained software is, in my opinion, fine with not receiving major version updates and only updating dependencies, but for something as potentially vulnerable as a web framework, it's safer to err on the side of caution and pick something that is more frequently updated instead.

## sqlite3

SQLite3 provides a relatively simple relational database that we can embed into our program's address space. It also has the added benefit of not requiring the end-user to bring up a dedicated SQL server.
